# Images Directory

This directory contains optimized images in multiple formats:
- AVIF: Best compression, modern browsers
- WebP: Good compression, wide browser support  
- JPEG: Universal fallback

## Naming Convention
Images follow this pattern:
- `image-name-400w-q85.avif` (400px wide, 85% quality, AVIF)
- `image-name-400w-q85.webp` (400px wide, 85% quality, WebP)
- `image-name-400w-q85.jpg` (400px wide, 85% quality, JPEG fallback)

## Responsive Breakpoints
- 400w: Mobile devices
- 800w: Tablets and small desktops
- 1200w: Desktop screens
- 1600w: Large displays and retina screens
